This web scraper scans the search results for a product on newegg

It then exports to the results to a csv file which can be opened with MS Excel

If an item is on sale the word SALE will appear in the first cell, otherwise the first cell is blank

Unfortunately newegg has blocked the program, and the results will no longer show up in the csv file
